============================================== System specifications ============================================== 

Static tiles
- Tiles that can't be modified during runtime (e.g. destroyed)
  - Can modified trough editor though
- An edge pool can be created from these tiles to reduce collision checks
  - Update edge pool when changes applied to this
- The vertex array containing this data can be constructed when app starts and reused (no need to re-calculate these)

Dialogue tree
- Create a specific datastructure for this
- Store npc and dialogues in json file
- Use similar text selection (option) as in menu scene?

Migrate to SDL3
- Replace sfml3
- sdl3_mixer not available yet

UI Layer
- Text rendering is part of this layer
- Used for inventory, skill trees, map, etc.
- Add ingame menu
  - Use to control sound, music, load from checkpoint etc.

Editor
- Wait until SDL3 migration completed
- Undo/redo in editor (could use ctrl+z)
- Add support for adding/modifying all the components

Shaders
- Use entity effects such as taking damage etc.

Testing
- Important to test collision and pathfinding

Multithreading
- Not a priority right now

Build
- Start using e.g. CMake
