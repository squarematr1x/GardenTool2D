============================================== System specifications ============================================== 

Refactor Scene files
- All other files are relatively simple

Add ingame menu [ ]
- Use to control sound, music, load from checkpoint etc.

UI [ ]
- Used for inventory, skill trees map, etc.

Saving/loading game [ ]
- Create/load save files
- Just modify player data in lvl as a starter

Dialogue tree [ ]
- Create a specific datastructure for this

Dynamic lighting [ ]
- In some levels everything could be dark, if no light source entity nearby etc.
- Point lights can be entities?

Shaders [ ]
- Draw background (parallax) [x], done without shaders atm
- Use entity effects such as taking damage etc.

Testing [ ]
- Use doctest for unit testing
- Important to test collision and pathfinding

Multithreading [ ]
- Not a priority right now

Build [ ]
- Start using e.g. CMake

Memory pooling for CPU cache coherent code [ ]
- entity-memory-pool.hpp is a skeleton for this
- No need to use shared pointers

Physics based emerging world [ ]
- Emerging behavior emerging from the system itself
  - Water makes entity wet, therefore it doesn't take as much fire damage
    Fire, however will eventually dry wet entity
    Electricity will hurt wet entity more in TextureName
    Frost will make wet surface ice, hence surface becomes slippery
  - This kind of system will give arise to all sorts of interesting phenomenan
- This could be used in puzzles as well as in combat
- It would be cool for players to discover unorthodoxed approaches to different problems
- This kind of system could be preferred over "scripted" predictable system

Editor [ ]
- Zoom reset button in editor
- Undo/redo in editor (could use ctrl+z)
